# The IntrepidCS API - Create your own software applications

**Overview**

The neoVI API provides a simple way to access the neoVI hardware with WIN32 development tools. This documentation describes how to use the API for custom applications. Each API has an example targeted for both C/C++, C#, and Visual Basic (VB). Operational examples are included for [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) Visual C++, [National Instruments](http://www.ni.com) LabVIEW, [National Instruments](http://www.ni.com) LabWindows CVI, [Borland](http://www.borland.com) C++ Builder, [Borland](http://www.borland.com) Delphi, and [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) Visual Basic.

Included with neoVI is the "icsneo40.dll" DLL. This DLL is a high performance multi-threaded DLL, capable of supporting many neoVI devices simultaneously. The DLL is through dynamic linkage.

For applications using neoVI and ValueCAN devices which do not use Windows, a [Linux interface](http://intrepidcs.com/support/ICSDocumentation/neoAPILinux/LinuxFrameMain.htm) is available. Intrepid Control Systems also has a [Github page](https://github.com/intrepidcs/) with APIs and projects for a verity of different system configurations. Code here can be built to fit the needed system.

**Getting Started**

To get started, review the Basic Operation topic and the topics describing how to use the API in Visual Basic .NET, Visual C++, Visual C#, LabWindows CVI, LabVIEW, Borland C++ Builder, Unity Engine, and Borland Delphi.
