# neoVI PRO UI - Vehicle Spy 3 Text API

**Objective**

The neoVI PRO user interface is accessed using the UI object. The syntax is as follows:

ui.clear ; clears the screen

**neoVI PRO Display**

The neoVI PRO has a 128 wide by 64 pixel high monochrome display. UI commands support x coordinates between 0 and 127 and y coordinates between 0 and 63. The UI commands supports two colors: blue (1) and white (0). Colors can be inverted using the invert command (useful in different lighting environments).
